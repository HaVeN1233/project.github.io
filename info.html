            This presentation teaches about Tuna Pastel
            and how it connects to protecting our oceans.  
            It explains how to make Tuna Pastel, 
            but more importantly,
            it shows why it's important to buy tuna that's been caught in a way that doesn't hurt the environment.  
            It talks about overfishing and other problems in the fishing industry, 
            and encourages everyone to choose sustainable tuna to help keep our oceans healthy.
